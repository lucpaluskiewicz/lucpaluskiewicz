# About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/), [Collège de France](https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr) and at the [EHESS](https://www.ehess.fr/fr).

My research interests are in Innovation Economics and Political Economy. I am supervised by [Philippe Aghion](https://www.philippeaghion.com/). 

During the academic 2025-2026 year, I will be co-organizing the [Brown Bag Economics of Innovation Seminar](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/evenements/brown-bag-economics-of-innovation-seminar/) which is a joint seminar between Collège de France and INSEAD. Feel free to contact me, [Raphaël Wargon](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/personnes/raphael-wargon/) or [Milla Tarpola](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/personnes/milla-tarpola/).
